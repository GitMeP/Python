# ðŸ§± Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python

OOPs is a way of organising code that uses objects and classes to represent real-world entities and their behaviours.

OOPs in Python is a programming paradigm that organises code into reusable and modular components called objects (OOPs helps you structure your code by grouping related data and behaviours into objects)

---
In the real world, we deal with process objects, such as students, employees, invoices, cars, etc. Objects are not only data and not only functions, but a combination of both.

Each real-world object has attributes and behaviours associated with it.

What is an Object?
It's always there in Python, but you don't exactly know what it is or where it is used.
