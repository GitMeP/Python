# ðŸ§± Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python

**OOPs** is a way of organising code that uses objects and classes to represent real-world entities and their behaviours.

OOPs in Python is a programming paradigm that organises code into reusable and modular components called objects (OOPs helps you structure your code by grouping related data and behaviours into objects)

---
- In the real world, we deal with **process objects** such as _students_, _employees_, _invoices_, _cars_, etc.  
- These **objects are not just data or functions**, but a **combination of both**.

Each real-world object has **attributes** and **behaviours** associated with it.

## Attributes

Each attribute will have value associated with it. Attributes represent the **data** associated with an object.

**Examples:**

- For a **student**:
  - `name`, `class`, `subject`, `marks`
- For an **employee**:
  - `name`, `department`, `designation`, `salary`

## Behaviour

Behaviour represents the **functions or actions** that operate on the attributes.

> In real life, **attributes and behaviour are not independent** rather they **co-exist**.

**Examples:**

- Compute the **percentage** of a student's marks
- Apply **GST** to an invoice value



### What is an Object?
It's always there in Python, but you may not be entirely familiar with what it is or where it is used.
