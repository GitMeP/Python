## 📚 What Is LangChain?

[LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain) is a powerful open-source framework that lets you:

- Connect **language models (LLMs)** like GPT with external tools (APIs, files, search, memory)
- Build **chains of logic** across LLM calls
- Create **autonomous agents** that act and reason
- Enable applications like chatbots, RAG systems, and smart assistants
