# ðŸ§± Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python

**OOPs** is a way of organising code that uses objects and classes to represent real-world entities and their behaviours.

OOPs in Python is a programming paradigm that organises code into reusable and modular components called objects (OOPs helps you structure your code by grouping related data and behaviours into objects)

---
* In the real world, we deal with process objects, such as 'students', 'employees', 'invoices', 'cars', etc. 
* Objects are not only data and not only functions, but a combination of both.

Each real-world object has attributes and behaviours associated with it.

* **Attributes**: Each attribute will have a value associated with it. An attribute is equivalent to data.
    - 'Name', 'class', 'subject', 'marks', etc of students.
    - 'Name', 'department', 'designation', 'salary', etc of the employee

* **Behaviour**: Processing attributes associated with an object. Behaviour is equivalent to function.
*In real Life, attributes and behaviour are not independent of each other; rather, they co-exist.*

'Example':
  => Compute the percentage of students' marks.
  => Apply GST to invoice value


### What is an Object?
It's always there in Python, but you may not be entirely familiar with what it is or where it is used.
