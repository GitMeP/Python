### Python and its features
Python is a high-level programming language known for its easy-to-use and read syntax and broad applications.
Some of python's key features are:
* Simple and readable syntax
* Interpreted language
* Dynamic typing (means we don't need to define the data type explicitly)
* Extensive libraries and framework support
* Cross-Platform Compatibility (meaning it can run on different  OS, including Windows, macOS, and Linux

### list and tiples
Lists and Tuples are fundamental Python data structures with distinct characteristics and use cases.
#### List:
* Mutable: Elements can be changed after creation.
* Memory Usage: Consumes more memory.
* Methods: Offers various built-in methods for manipulation.
* Performance: Slower iteration compared to tuples but better for insertion and deletion operations.
  
**Example:**
list_data = ["hello","welcome","to","python"]
list_data.append("learning")
print(data_list)

> Output: ["hello","welcome","to","python","learning"]

#### Tuples:
* Immutable: Elements cannot be changed after creation.
* Memory Usage: Consumes less memory.
* Methods: Limited built-in methods.
* Performance: Faster iteration compared to lists but lacks the flexibility of lists.
  
**Example:**
list_data = ("This","is","a","tuple")
print(list_data)

> Output: ("This","is","a","tuple")
